  <p class="small">
    Hello, and welcome! I’m Priyambada Bandyopadhyay, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Virginia Tech. My research interests lie in international finance, macroeconomic volatility, and behavioral economics. I’m passionate about teaching economics in ways that connect theory to real-world policy and decision-making. Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and exploring new places.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom:6px;">Job Market Paper: <em>Openness, The Sword of Damocles, and Output Volatility</em></h3>
    <p class="small">
      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
      This paper investigates how the risk of international capital outflows and their management impact macroeconomic volatility.
      There is substantial evidence suggesting that the limited growth effects of capital account openness can be partly explained
      by the sudden reversal of capital outflows, as seen during numerous financial crises, including the Mexican tequila crisis,
      the Asian financial crisis, and the Russian defaults. My research argues that financial openness can lead to higher output
      volatility and lower growth, even in the absence of actual capital outflows. To support this, I propose a theory showing that
      financial openness increases the risk of capital outflows, and that agents manage this risk by adjusting their portfolios
      toward riskier assets, resulting in higher output volatility and lower expected growth. To test this theory, I develop a new
      indicator from the IMF's <em>Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREER)</em> to measure how easily
      nonresidents can sell and transfer domestic equity and bond holdings. The pattern in the data suggests that even after controlling
      for various factors affecting output volatility, countries permitting unrestricted capital outflows experience higher output volatility.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom:6px;">Smoking Habits and Financial Decisions: Evidence from the NLSY79</h3>
    <p class="small">
      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
      A substantial body of evidence in experimental psychology indicates that smokers tend to be more risk-tolerant, impatient, and impulsive
      than non-smokers. As a result, smokers are inclined to make different economic decisions than non-smokers, which often manifests in financial
      and labor market behaviors. What is missing in this literature is a third category—quitters. The behaviors of this group may be particularly
      interesting because quitting smoking is a significant challenge and overcoming it may involve unique behavioral and psychological traits that
      affect their actions and outcomes. In this chapter, I use data from the NLSY79 to classify individuals into three groups—smokers, non-smokers,
      and quitters—and examine how these groups differ in their financial decisions, with potential implications for current and future credit access.
      We find that, compared to smokers, the rates of missed payments and bankruptcy are lower among quitters and non-smokers. Notably, in payment habits,
      quitters appear to be more prudent than non-smokers.
